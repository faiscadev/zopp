**zopp** is the open-source secrets manager that keeps your team's secrets safe with zero-knowledge encryption. Self-host it, own your data, and stay in control.

## Why zopp?

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Zero-Knowledge" icon="puzzle">
    Your secrets are encrypted client-side before they ever reach the server. The server stores only encrypted blobs and can never see your plaintext data.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Self-Hostable" icon="laptop">
    Deploy zopp on your own infrastructure. No vendor lock-in, no third-party access to your secrets. Your data stays where you control it.
  </Card>
  <Card title="CLI-First" icon="seti:powershell">
    Designed for developers who live in the terminal. Import/export `.env` files, inject secrets into processes, and integrate with your existing workflow.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Team Collaboration" icon="open-book">
    Share secrets securely across your team with workspace invites. Fine-grained RBAC controls who can read, write, or admin each environment.

## Quick Example

```bash
# Set a secret
zopp secret set DATABASE_URL "postgresql://user:pass@localhost/db"

# Get a secret
zopp secret get DATABASE_URL

# Run a command with secrets injected
zopp run -- npm start

# Export to .env file
zopp secret export -o .env
```

## How It Works

zopp uses a hierarchical key encryption scheme:

```
User
 └── Principal (your device)
      └── Workspace (your team)
           └── KEK (wrapped per-principal via ECDH)
                └── Environment (dev, staging, prod)
                     └── DEK (wrapped with KEK)
                          └── Secrets (encrypted with DEK)
```

Every layer is encrypted. The server only stores wrapped keys and encrypted secrets—it never has access to plaintext.
